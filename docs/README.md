## Understanding trade terms
> The following is a term dictionary for edits and buy/sell channel terms. These definitions will help you trade more effectively.

__Notables only__ - Only the skins with value; aka, those that you cannot find in the shop all year or in past essence sphere.

__DMM__ - A semi-permanent bind. A bit of a hassle to deal with.

* *Ghost DMM* - A DMM that the owner does not have access to, but is not deactived/has no deactivation proof.
* *Dead DMM* - A deactivated DMM.
* *Active/Alive DMM* - A DMM that the owner has access to.

__B/O__ or __BUYOUT__ - An amount that, if offered, means that the account is reserved for the person who offered it. Not always respect by seller.

__H/O__ - Highest offer.

__LF__ - Looking for.

__IA__ - Instant accept.

__ID__ - Instant deny.

## Making your edit
While there are always a few people willing to make you an edits, it's good practice to make your own.
1. Open Identity V and take pictures of the skins you own; make sure not to miss any, especially if you have a small account.
 1. You can see this easily if you have a room by clicking the button you use to change skins in your room, but this only works for characters you own.
 2. Only take pictures of the "card" that skins have, not the model.
2. Get any photo editing software. If you're on PC I recommend [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) or [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) for beginners, because they're quite straightforward. Both are free. I have heard that mobile editors like Picsart, where you can search for skins as stickers instead of importing them. I have not tried it personally.
3. Open the [Identity V Wiki](https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Identity_V_Wiki), then go back to your editing software.
4. Create a 1500x2500 canvas. If you took your photos from earlier in the room skin change, you can import all of those pictures as layers and work from there; if not, then you're going to have to grab images directly from the wiki, one at a time.
 1. This shit literally takes forever; don't be afraid to go notables only.
5. Take a look at this [small Imgur album of edit examples](https://imgur.com/a/s01ZhSA). You'll want to include the following on your edit: DMM Status, Server (Asia or NA/EU), Device (iOS or Asia), and your social media tag like Discord, Insta, etc).
6. After you've added your skins and the above information, you're good to go! You don't have to make your edits very fancy, but some people like to.

## Joining trade servers + Discord notes
Discord is by far the best and safest way to trade Identity V accounts, but only if you go about it safely. This guide, therefore, will only focus on Discord trading. If you have a recent Discord account (made in the past four months), you're going to have trouble trading because most people will not trade or perform services for you. This is because your UID is too new if it begins with a 9, and people would rather not risk possible scammer accounts.
> [How to find your Discord UID.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

If you're still willing to navigate Discord (9 UID or not), you have to then pick reputable servers to join. Obviously, I'm going to plug the servers I'm staff in; [Trading Nexus](https://discord.gg/hXYz3ZqcAq) and [Antonio's Concert Hall](https://discord.gg/2WRDvZ2DEU). Say hi if you want; my display name is almost always "seer gaming." At the time of posting this, [Illusion Hall](https://discord.gg/mYJnmnUywP) is the biggest trade server. There is also a list compiled in [my trading help server](https://discord.gg/pqFk793nU7), which may help you organize better and join servers quicker. You are not required to join, of course, as I'll post most things from there here as well; however, I personally find it easier to check that way.

# Account worth and offering

Theoretically, your first step should be to have your account evaluated in a server evaluation channel. Theoretically is key here, because evaluation channels usually run slower than a weed smoking snail and you'll probably have a hard time figuring out exactly what you can do without knowing your worth.

To remedy this major inconvienence, I've created a semi-comprehensive way to find your account worth. Follow along as best as you can!

> 1 - Do you have any skins with the limited tag? If *yes*, check the "skins" part of the website and get a better idea that way. Usually the older the skin and the more popular the character, the higher the skin is worth.\
2 - What is your server and device? The highest value combo is iOS/NAEU, and the account worth pecking order goes from iOS NAEU -> Android NAEU -> iOS Asia -> Android Asia, but with device transfer device is less relevant.\
3 - Do you have any crossover or COA skins? Persona is the highest value crossover, and COA3 is the first COA with its own tag (outside of the "limited" one). Persona accounts can fetch a lot of money and are very good for trading, and people do look for COA3-4-5 skins often. Usually they don't want the hunter ones, though, unless it's Michiko's Eternal Aurora, which goes for about 15 USD.\

If your account doesn't look like it fits any of this, with very few exceptions, its worth is pretty low. However, if you have time-limited skins (shop skins that only come back at certain times of the year, like Lady Bella), you could still trade up slightly. If you actually want to trade up quickly and find yourself in this situation, I would recommend selling your account for whatever you can get for it and then buying an account that is worth slightly more or is more tradeable. More about this in the strategic sections.

## Advertisting
Make sure to post your advertisement in the appropriate channel; you'll find they're all labelled. Though servers may have their own format for account posting, the following works pretty universally:
>__LF__: skins\
__IA__: skins\
__ID__: skins\
__EXTRA__: extra info\
(edit image)

## Offering
It's finally time to begin offering! There's some ettiquite and rules you should know before you start. Please do not lowball people who have accounts obviously worth more than yours; for example, don't offer your Gilda smurf for Mr. Swifts. Try your best to respect LFs and IDs, especially cross-server cross-device ones. You're not funny, you're just annoying. Most people in general chats would kindly lend a hand to you, and if you ask for help there's a good chance someone will volunteer to take your questions.

When DMing someone with an offer, give them a small greeting, your account edit, and any other pertinent info or smalltalk you'd like to make. People prefer this to be in only one Discord message as to reduce spam.

## Accepting a trade
Before you accept any offers, make sure to background check the person you're trading with. Here's what most people do:
1. Search the user's UID in a scammer doc; [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nCHqgFQH1E3R1WLFwQ6aOuikT-FGaqSD9cqYHqWtLI/edit) [are](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AM9iMRrPbH346Ok3K7MG8Xc9dZk31MRM0b8rg-mu_o/edit
) [four](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZ_rVjhcPTQv0HERPH9SmZNZagozt7A-t1lzTT1lE1M/edit
) [good](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-VhlLzrvWGUB88nxRejwe-4oJjKCASlDGwHlUhN5VQ/edit
) ones.
2. Search the user's UID in two to three larger server; I recommend, at the very least, using Illusion Hall.
3. If the account seems like a very big highball (offer that is way over your account's worth), look up the main three skins in a server with an account lookout channel.

A good middleman should do this anyways, but you should make sure you're keeping yourself safe first. Ask for second opinions if you're not sure about that person or a trade!

# Commencing the trade

No matter what someone tells you, no matter how trusted they are, do <b>not</b> do a trust trade. That is just a recipe for disaster. Instead, ping for a middleman in a server with 1k+ members, dedicated to Identity V trading. Again, if you're not sure, <i>ask</i>. As a rule of thumb, I like to pick middlemen with at least 50 vouches, all recorded in a way I can view directly (Discord messages, usually in their own private server connected to a public one, or a public one itself).
