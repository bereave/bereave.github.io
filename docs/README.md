# Basics
> This documentation is only meant to serve as a resource. If you have further questions, check out [my trading help server](https://discord.gg/pqFk793nU7) -- just like this documentation, though, it's still a heavy WIP. If you would like to help with writing documentation or answering questions, join the server as well and DM me (seer gaming) directly. We're currently in idvDocs ver 1.0, the initial release!

## Understanding trade terms
> The following is a term dictionary for edits and buy/sell channel terms. These definitions will help you trade more effectively.

__Notables only__ - Only the skins with value; aka, those that you cannot find in the shop all year or in past essence sphere.

__DMM__ - A semi-permanent bind. A bit of a hassle to deal with.

* *Ghost DMM* - A DMM that the owner does not have access to, but is not deactived/has no deactivation proof.
* *Dead DMM* - A deactivated DMM.
* *Active/Alive DMM* - A DMM that the owner has access to.

__B/O__ or __BUYOUT__ - An amount that, if offered, means that the account is reserved for the person who offered it. Not always respect by seller.

__H/O__ - Highest offer.

__LF__ - Looking for.

__IA__ - Instant accept.

__ID__ - Instant deny.

## Making your edit
While there are always a few people willing to make you an edits, it's good practice to make your own.
1. Open Identity V and take pictures of the skins you own; make sure not to miss any, especially if you have a small account.
 1. You can see this easily if you have a room by clicking the button you use to change skins in your room, but this only works for characters you own.
 2. Only take pictures of the "card" that skins have, not the model.
2. Get any photo editing software. If you're on PC I recommend [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) or [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) for beginners, because they're quite straightforward. Both are free. I have heard that mobile editors like Picsart, where you can search for skins as stickers instead of importing them. I have not tried it personally.
3. Open the [Identity V Wiki](https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Identity_V_Wiki), then go back to your editing software.
4. Create a 1500x2500 canvas. If you took your photos from earlier in the room skin change, you can import all of those pictures as layers and work from there; if not, then you're going to have to grab images directly from the wiki, one at a time.
 1. This shit literally takes forever; don't be afraid to go notables only.
5. Take a look at this [small Imgur album of edit examples](https://imgur.com/a/s01ZhSA). You'll want to include the following on your edit: DMM Status, Server (Asia or NA/EU), Device (iOS or Android), and your social media tag like Discord, Insta, etc).
6. After you've added your skins and the above information, you're good to go! You don't have to make your edits very fancy, but some people like to.

## Joining trade servers + Discord notes
Discord is by far the best and safest way to trade Identity V accounts, but only if you go about it safely. This guide, therefore, will only focus on Discord trading. If you have a recent Discord account (made in the past four months), you're going to have trouble trading because most people will not trade or perform services for you. This is because your UID is too new if it begins with a 9, and people would rather not risk possible scammer accounts.
> [How to find your Discord UID.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

If you're still willing to navigate Discord (9 UID or not), you have to then pick reputable servers to join. Obviously, I'm going to plug the servers I'm staff in; [Trading Nexus](https://discord.gg/hXYz3ZqcAq) and [Truth & Inference Detective Agency](https://discord.gg/4BSueyPWkx). Say hi if you want; my display name is almost always "seer gaming." At the time of posting this, [Illusion Hall](https://discord.gg/mYJnmnUywP) is the biggest trade server. There is also a list compiled in [my trading help server](https://discord.gg/pqFk793nU7), which may help you organize better and join servers quicker. You are not required to join, of course, as I'll post most things from there here as well; however, I personally find it easier to check that way.

# Account worth and offering

Theoretically, your first step should be to have your account evaluated in a server evaluation channel. Theoretically is key here, because evaluation channels usually run slower than a weed smoking snail and you'll probably have a hard time figuring out exactly what you can do without knowing your worth.

To remedy this major inconvienence, I've created a semi-comprehensive way to find your account worth. Follow along as best as you can!

> 1 - Do you have any skins with the limited tag? If *yes*, check the "skins" part of the website and get a better idea that way. Usually the older the skin and the more popular the character, the higher the skin is worth.\
2 - What is your server and device? The highest value combo is iOS/NAEU, and the account worth pecking order goes from iOS NAEU -> Android NAEU -> iOS Asia -> Android Asia, but with device transfer device is less relevant.\
3 - Do you have any crossover or COA skins? Persona is the highest value crossover, and COA3 is the first COA with its own tag (outside of the "limited" one). Persona accounts can fetch a lot of money and are very good for trading, and people do look for COA3-4-5 skins often. Usually they don't want the hunter ones, though, unless it's Michiko's Eternal Aurora, which goes for about 15 USD.

If your account doesn't look like it fits any of this, with very few exceptions, its worth is pretty low. However, if you have time-limited skins (shop skins that only come back at certain times of the year, like Lady Bella), you could still trade up slightly. If you actually want to trade up quickly and find yourself in this situation, I would recommend selling your account for whatever you can get for it and then buying an account that is worth slightly more or is more tradeable. More about this in the strategic sections.

## Advertisting
Make sure to post your advertisement in the appropriate channel; you'll find they're all labelled. Though servers may have their own format for account posting, the following works pretty universally:
>__LF__: skins\
__IA__: skins\
__ID__: skins\
__EXTRA__: extra info\
(edit image)

## Offering
It's finally time to begin offering! There's some ettiquite and rules you should know before you start. Please do not lowball people who have accounts obviously worth more than yours; for example, don't offer your Gilda smurf for Mr. Swifts. Try your best to respect LFs and IDs, especially cross-server cross-device ones. You're not funny, you're just annoying. Most people in general chats would kindly lend a hand to you, and if you ask for help there's a good chance someone will volunteer to take your questions.

When DMing someone with an offer, give them a small greeting, your account edit, and any other pertinent info or smalltalk you'd like to make. People prefer this to be in only one Discord message as to reduce spam.

## Accepting a trade
Before you accept any offers, make sure to background check the person you're trading with. Here's what most people do:
1. Search the user's UID in a scammer doc; [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nCHqgFQH1E3R1WLFwQ6aOuikT-FGaqSD9cqYHqWtLI/edit) [are](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AM9iMRrPbH346Ok3K7MG8Xc9dZk31MRM0b8rg-mu_o/edit
) [four](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZ_rVjhcPTQv0HERPH9SmZNZagozt7A-t1lzTT1lE1M/edit
) [good](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-VhlLzrvWGUB88nxRejwe-4oJjKCASlDGwHlUhN5VQ/edit
) ones.
2. Search the user's UID in two to three larger servers; I recommend, at the very least, using Illusion Hall, but [IDVTAS](https://discord.gg/BmJgAFkjmq) is a super amazing resource for finding scam reports and alt massbans.
3. If the account seems like a very big highball (offer that is way over your account's worth), look up the main three skins in a server with an account lookout channel.

A good middleman should do this anyways, but you should make sure you're keeping yourself safe first. Ask for second opinions if you're not sure about that person or a trade!

# Commencing the trade

No matter what someone tells you, no matter how trusted they are, do <b>not</b> do a trust trade. That is just a recipe for disaster. Instead, ping for a middleman in a server with 500+ members, dedicated to Identity V trading, and is trusted in other servers you ask in or is partnered with a lot or prominent servers if it is not one itself. (Please do not use IDV Global Market.) Again, if you're not sure, <i>ask</i>. As a rule of thumb, I like to pick middlemen with at least 50 vouches, all recorded in a way I can view directly (Discord messages, usually in their own private server connected to a public one, or a public one itself). Background check your middleman as well! You never know what you may find; there's often impersonaters and scam MMs that pop up.

## MM Process

If you middleman skips any steps in this process, <i>do not be afraid to ask about it</i>. You have to advocate for yourself, and stay vigilant. (Thanks for the material, Eks, I am really lazy and don't want to type this section.) This is a trade process; the difference between sale and trade processes will be explained in a moment.
1. States what the objective for the trade is and where you can find their vouches.
2. Asks for account edits and what the server, device, device transfer, and DMM statuses are for the accounts. They should also ask if either user is the original owner of their account, if there is any known any leech history, if the account has had a DMM removal, if is there any echo debt, and if there are any installment trials.
3. After receiving the transaction details, asks the traders to send them the login details via DMs (if it's an account with an active DMM that is the only login info needed).
4. If all skins shown on the edit are featured on the account, if anything is missing
> - If there are any negative echoes
 - If there is anything suspicious on the account:  non-standard persona names, guild chats, team chats or most recent friend chats, low morality points 
> - If there is an active secondary password, they'll ask for the info if there is one and remove it themself
> - If there is an unstated DMM, force-closed secondary password
> - If there are any instalment trials on the account (skins, characters, accessories, lobbies)
> - Anything the trader asks for - it could be specific accessories, the account rank, limited emotes etc. 
They will then send a picture of notable skins to the trader so you can confirm the skins are there, from the lobby or from the book section if unowned, mention how the checking of each criteria goes. It is totally appropriate to ask for pictures of everything as well, if you would prefer to be thorough.
5. After they switch to their own binds and secure the account, they'll ask for logout proof. Here is how proper logout proof is done:
> - Begin the video with the groupchat the trade is happening in
> - Then the time it is being recorded during is shown (so you know it isn't pre-recorded)
> - Going to Identity V
> - Show the binds to confirm they're yours and not theirs anymore
> - Clicking the Logout button
> - Show the binds again to confirm they're not logged into any account anymore
> - The group chat again (not necessary, but recommended)
> - *** !! FOR ANDROID !!, logout proof includes making a guest account as you can't directly logout on that OS.
6. They'll repeat this for the other account; once both logout proofs are sent they'll bind your new accounts and allow you in. Take a photo and send it in the chat as login proof.
7. The MM will do their own logout proof. Please change any passwords they have accessed, just in case.

### MM Process - Sale

The beginning of a sale follows the same structure as a trade, but the MM will secure the account + get logout proof from the seller, then make sure the seller recives money from the buyer, then give the account to the buyer.

# Anti-scam, for dummies

While some of the above sections have info on how to do basic anti-scam (especially the background check instructions), this one will list the most common scams that cannot be prevented by using a middleman and how to avoid them. If you did not use a middleman and got scammed, which is <i>very</i> likely if you choose to trade without one, you can contact me on Discord for help instead. However, please recognize I'm pretty busy and I recommend that instead of contacting me you create a scammer report ticket in a trusted server, so that you can have more help and have other eyes to look at your evidence. <b>Please</b> screenshot all evidence you have if you've been scammed, including but not limited to as much of the conversation with the scammer(s) as you can, in-game evidence, et cetera.

## Complete basics

When you get an account, create a secondary password or change the secondary password already on it to one only you know. Then, close the IDV app and reopen it, but don't log into the game yet. Go to the bottom right corner and click where it tells you your server, NA/EU or Asia, and switch to the other one. Then, log into the game; if it gives you a tutorial screen, just proceed as to skip the tutorial and enter a name, then once you're in that new account set a secondary password there as well. Check your secondary password on your main side once every day, and on your opposite server side once every two days. If there is a "force close request," someone else entered your account and is trying to delete your password, most probably to steal it.

### Leeches

A "leech" is a scammer that never truly logged out of an account, and is usually on a different device or has a friend logged in. You see, when IDV account binds are changed it doesn't kick out anyone who is logged in, and people can lie about what devices they have for logout proof. You can tell a leech has logged in by checking your secondary password for force close requests, your persona builds for odd behaviour, your messages for odd behaviour, matches that were played that you didn't play, and most obviously notifications interrupting your play that say "account was logged in from other place" or something along those lines. Again, make sure you have a secondary password. Without one, leeches are able to perform device transfer (DT) or same device transfers (SDT) and kick <i>you</i> off of the account. If they have the DMM removal method, which is circulating still in scammer circles, they can also perform one to remove you off of the account.

#### Kicking a leech

Immediately once you notice leech activity, check if account migration/DT is open for you. If it is, perform the steps described in the Device Transfer section under Native -> Native transfer.


This will kick all leeches from your account, but uses your transfer code. If device transfer isn't open, feel free to consult me or any other scammer force member that has DMs open for what to do next. You may need to look into DMM removal, but you also may not; again, consult first.

### Echo refund

Scammers who have spend money on the account via credit or debit card can refund their money and put your account into echo debt, making it unable to play matches in any gamemode (except Crystal Ball Tarot, unless they've fixed that) until the debt is paid off. This sucks and is totally unavoidable, so... yeah. Be wary of account with many echos.

### IDK what happened

You should have opened a scam report ticket anyways, but especially do so if this is occuring.

# DMM
## Creating a DMM account
This process is much easier on PC, and I've never attempted it on mobile. However, I believe the steps are the same; the interface just isn't streamlined.
1. Go to DMM.com. You'll probably find that the website is in Japanese; don't worry, you just need to be able to match the characters I provide below to the buttons. The English version of the site doesn't work sometimes.
2. Go to the top right corner and hover over the icon that looks like a person. You'll see a yellow buttton that says DMMアカウント登録; click it. The other button allows you to login, this is registration.
3. Make sure you have a Google account ready, and click the Googleで登録 button. All you have to do here is choose a Google account and the DMM will automatically be created attached to it; this is because DMM links occasionally come broken.
4. Click the yellow button it shows you next, and uncheck the box unless you'd like to get DMM email spammed.
5. Hover over the person icon, and you should not see a yellow button now. Click the top right option on the menu that pops up; it is the only one in its section, and is labelled DMMアカウント情報.
6. You should be on a screen with some information now, particularly one displaying the gmail you used to make this account. This section should be labelled メールアドレス; look below it and you will see パスワード, where you will add a password to the account as it doesn't inherit the gmail password. Click the 編集 button on the right of this section, and then the grey button that appears next.
7. Check your email. There will be a new email from DMM with the subject DMM: パスワード再設定手続きのお知らせ, and you'll see a long link near the top of it. Click the link, then type in your new password in both boxes; it should be 6-36 characters alphanumeric, and though some other characters are allowed it's not really worth experimenting right now. Click the grey button once you're done, and the next one as well.
8. You should be back at the information screen from before. Scroll to the bottom of the page and you should see a horizontal menu of five buttons; you'll be clicking the one labelled 外部サービス連携, which is also on the top right of the grid.
9. You should be in a window that displays four types of social media; Google, Twitter, LINE and Facebook. The Google one will have text in red and a greyed out box; click the greyed out box and it should turn yellow. Your Google account is now disconnected from the DMM, but the email remains connected; this will be useful later.
10. Hover over the person icon and click the box above everything else, labelled ログアウト. This logs you out of your DMM. Hover again and click the grey box to the right of the yellow box, labelled ログイン. Enter your email in the first box and your password in the second, then click the pink box under that section. You should get logged back into your account.

## Adding DMM to IDV
1. Open IDV and go to your account's binds; you should see your account's current binds. Click the DMM button and enter the login info to your DMM account.
2. A screen is going to pop up with a few things on it. For the text box just enter a name, and for the date enter anything that's over 18 years ago.
3. Click the button at the bottom of the screen; you should get a message that says "DMM login failed." This doesn't matter, though.
4. Try to bind DMM again, and it should work.

## Transferring a DMM
1. Log into the DMM and go to the profile/information screen that shows your email and allows you to change your password. Check the 外部サービス連携 section for any third party binds, and unbind them. This is step 9 of the Creating a DMM account process, if you are not sure how.
2. Click the 編集 button on the right side of your email, and enter the email you are transferring to twice. Click the right side button with a red triangle pointing to the right twice.
3. Check the new email's email; you should get a long link. Click it and just click the grey button that pops up. The email should be transferred.
4. Change the password of the DMM account, or instruct the new DMM owner to do so and give them the current password; you must be logged in to transfer anything. This is steps 6-7 of the Creating a DMM account section.
5. Make sure the new user can log in.

# Data/Device Transfer
While this is usually known as device transfer, I encourage you to call it data transfer instead, as that is what it really does. From now on I'll just call it "DT." I've attempted to simplify some computing terms here, so they're not exactly their technical definitions and have been adapted to explain easier.

## DT Dictionary + BG Info
__Login Key__ - this is what your app sends to the IDV server to let you into your session
__Session__ - the period you're logged into your account
__Data__ - the data (skins, username, etc) of your account
__New bind__ - A bind that is currently not binded to any IDV account. You have to have this before doing a transfer.
- Your login key, once confirmed via logging in with a bind, starts a session.
- This session exists on your device for as long as you're actively on the IDV account.
- Sessions cannot be forcibly ended unless there is a login from another location.
- Sessions allow you to ACCESS data , not contain the data themselves.
- Data is NOT equal to binds ; binds access a login key which access a session which accesses data.

## What does a DT do?
DT works by changing the DATA that a LOGIN KEY accesses.
1. When DT is used it generates a new LOGIN KEY to access your DATA
2. Another login key is given to your SESSION to access after; this has no information on it, so you get the Orpheus tutorial screen
3. Because a SESSION cannot be ended forcibly, the other person can still mess with DATA until they close the IDV app [from actively running] or switch accounts; they cannot switch binds or anything along those lines, as said above.
## DT Trades
This following terms aren't trading terms, but I will be using them to better describe how transfers are to be done in a trade context.
__Native Device__ - your OS, iOS or Android
__Foreign Device__ = the opposite OS to yours; if you have iOS it's Android, etc

## How to Native -> Foriegn DT
1. Go to settings -> Safety (last tab) -> Account Migration and generate a code and password. Make your password very easy; I like using "kitten".
2. Screenshot the code and password so you don't lose them.
3. Have the person on the new device/the new device go to the switch account section and click migration; it's the bottom right, with two arrows.
4. Enter the code and password, then confirm. It should say "transfer successful."
5. Click the screen and log in; your account should be there. Bind the new bind to the account.
6. Switch to one of your old binds and you'll be put onto a tutorial screen; close the app, then reopen it, and unbind your old binds.
7. Switch back to your new bind, which should still take you to the your account. you can keep using this new bind or add your old binds back to this new account.

5. Click the screen and log in; your account should be there. Bind the new bind to the account.
5. Bind to new bind.
6. Switch to one of your old binds and you'll be put onto a tutorial screen; close the app, then reopen it, and unbind your old binds.
7. Switch back to your new bind, which should still take you to the your account. you can keep using this new bind or add your old binds back to this new account.
