## Understanding trade terms
> The following is a term dictionary for edits and buy/sell channel terms. These definitions will help you trade more effectively.

__Notables only__ - Only the skins with value; aka, those that you cannot find in the shop all year or in past essence sphere.

__DMM__ - A semi-permanent bind. A bit of a hassle to deal with.

* *Ghost DMM* - A DMM that the owner does not have access to, but is not deactived/has no deactivation proof.
* *Dead DMM* - A deactivated DMM.
* *Active/Alive DMM* - A DMM that the owner has access to.

__B/O__ or __BUYOUT__ - An amount that, if offered, means that the account is reserved for the person who offered it. Not always respect by seller.

__H/O__ - Highest offer.

__LF__ - Looking for.

__IA__ - Instant accept.

__ID__ - Instant deny.

## Making your edit
While there are always a few people willing to make you an edits, it's good practice to make your own.
1. Open Identity V and take pictures of the skins you own; make sure not to miss any, especially if you have a small account.
 1. You can see this easily if you have a room by clicking the button you use to change skins in your room, but this only works for characters you own.
 2. Only take pictures of the "card" that skins have, not the model.
2. Get any photo editing software. If you're on PC I recommend [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) or [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) for beginners, because they're quite straightforward. Both are free. I have heard that mobile editors like Picsart, where you can search for skins as stickers instead of importing them. I have not tried it personally.
3. Open the [Identity V Wiki](https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Identity_V_Wiki), then go back to your editing software.
4. Create a 1500x2500 canvas. If you took your photos from earlier in the room skin change, you can import all of those pictures as layers and work from there; if not, then you're going to have to grab images directly from the wiki, one at a time.
 1. This shit literally takes forever; don't be afraid to go notables only.
5. Take a look at this [small Imgur album of edit examples](https://imgur.com/a/s01ZhSA). You'll want to include the following on your edit: DMM Status, Server (Asia or NA/EU), Device (iOS or Asia), and your social media tag like Discord, Insta, etc).
6. After you've added your skins and the above information, you're good to go! You don't have to make your edits very fancy, but some people like to.

## Joining trade servers + Discord notes
Discord is by far the best and safest way to trade Identity V accounts, but only if you go about it safely. This guide, therefore, will only focus on Discord trading. If you have a recent Discord account (made in the past four months), you're going to have trouble trading because most people will not trade or perform services for you. This is because your UID is too new if it begins with a 9, and people would rather not risk possible scammer accounts.
> [How to find your Discord UID.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

If you're still willing to navigate Discord (9 UID or not), you have to then pick reputable servers to join. Obviously, I'm going to plug the servers I'm staff in; [Trading Nexus](https://discord.gg/hXYz3ZqcAq) and [Truth & Inference Detective Agency](https://discord.gg/4BSueyPWkx). Say hi if you want; my display name is almost always "seer gaming." At the time of posting this, [Illusion Hall](https://discord.gg/mYJnmnUywP) is the biggest trade server. There is also a list compiled in [my trading help server](https://discord.gg/pqFk793nU7), which may help you organize better and join servers quicker. You are not required to join, of course, as I'll post most things from there here as well; however, I personally find it easier to check that way.

# Account worth and offering

Theoretically, your first step should be to have your account evaluated in a server evaluation channel. Theoretically is key here, because evaluation channels usually run slower than a weed smoking snail and you'll probably have a hard time figuring out exactly what you can do without knowing your worth.

To remedy this major inconvienence, I've created a semi-comprehensive way to find your account worth. Follow along as best as you can!

> 1 - Do you have any skins with the limited tag? If *yes*, check the "skins" part of the website and get a better idea that way. Usually the older the skin and the more popular the character, the higher the skin is worth.\
2 - What is your server and device? The highest value combo is iOS/NAEU, and the account worth pecking order goes from iOS NAEU -> Android NAEU -> iOS Asia -> Android Asia, but with device transfer device is less relevant.\
3 - Do you have any crossover or COA skins? Persona is the highest value crossover, and COA3 is the first COA with its own tag (outside of the "limited" one). Persona accounts can fetch a lot of money and are very good for trading, and people do look for COA3-4-5 skins often. Usually they don't want the hunter ones, though, unless it's Michiko's Eternal Aurora, which goes for about 15 USD.

If your account doesn't look like it fits any of this, with very few exceptions, its worth is pretty low. However, if you have time-limited skins (shop skins that only come back at certain times of the year, like Lady Bella), you could still trade up slightly. If you actually want to trade up quickly and find yourself in this situation, I would recommend selling your account for whatever you can get for it and then buying an account that is worth slightly more or is more tradeable. More about this in the strategic sections.

## Advertisting
Make sure to post your advertisement in the appropriate channel; you'll find they're all labelled. Though servers may have their own format for account posting, the following works pretty universally:
>__LF__: skins\
__IA__: skins\
__ID__: skins\
__EXTRA__: extra info\
(edit image)

## Offering
It's finally time to begin offering! There's some ettiquite and rules you should know before you start. Please do not lowball people who have accounts obviously worth more than yours; for example, don't offer your Gilda smurf for Mr. Swifts. Try your best to respect LFs and IDs, especially cross-server cross-device ones. You're not funny, you're just annoying. Most people in general chats would kindly lend a hand to you, and if you ask for help there's a good chance someone will volunteer to take your questions.

When DMing someone with an offer, give them a small greeting, your account edit, and any other pertinent info or smalltalk you'd like to make. People prefer this to be in only one Discord message as to reduce spam.

## Accepting a trade
Before you accept any offers, make sure to background check the person you're trading with. Here's what most people do:
1. Search the user's UID in a scammer doc; [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nCHqgFQH1E3R1WLFwQ6aOuikT-FGaqSD9cqYHqWtLI/edit) [are](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AM9iMRrPbH346Ok3K7MG8Xc9dZk31MRM0b8rg-mu_o/edit
) [four](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZ_rVjhcPTQv0HERPH9SmZNZagozt7A-t1lzTT1lE1M/edit
) [good](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-VhlLzrvWGUB88nxRejwe-4oJjKCASlDGwHlUhN5VQ/edit
) ones.
2. Search the user's UID in two to three larger server; I recommend, at the very least, using Illusion Hall.
3. If the account seems like a very big highball (offer that is way over your account's worth), look up the main three skins in a server with an account lookout channel.

A good middleman should do this anyways, but you should make sure you're keeping yourself safe first. Ask for second opinions if you're not sure about that person or a trade!

# Commencing the trade

No matter what someone tells you, no matter how trusted they are, do <b>not</b> do a trust trade. That is just a recipe for disaster. Instead, ping for a middleman in a server with 500+ members, dedicated to Identity V trading, and is trusted in other servers you ask in or is partnered with a lot or prominent servers if it is not one itself. (Please do not use IDV Global Market.) Again, if you're not sure, <i>ask</i>. As a rule of thumb, I like to pick middlemen with at least 50 vouches, all recorded in a way I can view directly (Discord messages, usually in their own private server connected to a public one, or a public one itself). Background check your middleman as well! You never know what you may find; there's often impersonaters and scam MMs that pop up.

## MM Process

If you middleman skips any steps in this process, <i>do not be afraid to ask about it</i>. You have to advocate for yourself, and stay vigilant. (Thanks for the material, Eks, I am really lazy and don't want to type this section.) This is a trade process; the difference between sale and trade processes will be explained in a moment.
1. States what the objective for the trade is and where you can find their vouches.
2. Asks for account edits and what the server, device, device transfer, and DMM statuses are for the accounts. They should also ask if either user is the original owner of their account, if there is any known any leech history, if the account has had a DMM removal, if is there any echo debt, and if there are any installment trials.
3. After receiving the transaction details, asks the traders to send them the login details via DMs (if it's an account with an active DMM that is the only login info needed).
4. If all skins shown on the edit are featured on the account, if anything is missing
> - If there are any negative echoes
 - If there is anything suspicious on the account:  non-standard persona names, guild chats, team chats or most recent friend chats, low morality points 
> - If there is an active secondary password, they'll ask for the info if there is one and remove it themself
> - If there is an unstated DMM, force-closed secondary password
> - If there are any instalment trials on the account (skins, characters, accessories, lobbies)
> - Anything the trader asks for - it could be specific accessories, the account rank, limited emotes etc. 
They will then send a picture of notable skins to the trader so you can confirm the skins are there, from the lobby or from the book section if unowned, mention how the checking of each criteria goes. It is totally appropriate to ask for pictures of everything as well, if you would prefer to be thorough.
5. After they switch to their own binds and secure the account, they'll ask for logout proof. Here is how proper logout proof is done:
> - Begin the video with the groupchat the trade is happening in
> - Then the time it is being recorded during is shown (so you know it isn't pre-recorded)
> - Going to Identity V
> - Show the binds to confirm they're yours and not theirs anymore
> - Clicking the Logout button
> - Show the binds again to confirm they're not logged into any account anymore
> - The group chat again (not necessary, but recommended)
> - *** !! FOR ANDROID !!, logout proof includes making a guest account as you can't directly logout on that OS.
6. They'll repeat this for the other account; once both logout proofs are sent they'll bind your new accounts and allow you in. Take a photo and send it in the chat as login proof.
7. The MM will do their own logout proof. Please change any passwords they have accessed, just in case.

### MM Process - Sale

The beginning of a sale follows the same structure as a trade, but the MM will secure the account + get logout proof from the seller, then make sure the seller recives money from the buyer, then give the account to the buyer.

# Anti-scam, for dummies

While some of the above sections have info on how to do basic anti-scam (especially the background check instructions), this one will list the most common scams that cannot be prevented by using a middleman and how to avoid them. If you did not use a middleman and got scammed, which is <i>very</i> likely if you choose to trade without one, you can contact me on Discord for help instead. However, please recognize I'm pretty busy and I recommend that instead of contacting me you create a scammer report ticket in a trusted server, so that you can have more help and have other eyes to look at your evidence. <b>Please</b> screenshot all evidence you have if you've been scammed, including but not limited to as much of the conversation with the scammer(s) as you can, in-game evidence, et cetera.

## Complete basics

When you get an account, create a secondary password or change the secondary password already on it to one only you know. Then, close the IDV app and reopen it, but don't log into the game yet. Go to the bottom right corner and click where it tells you your server, NA/EU or Asia, and switch to the other one. Then, log into the game; if it gives you a tutorial screen, just proceed as to skip the tutorial and enter a name, then once you're in that new account set a secondary password there as well. Check your secondary password on your main side once every day, and on your opposite server side once every two days. If there is a "force close request," someone else entered your account and is trying to delete your password, most probably to steal it.

## Leeches

A "leech" is a scammer that never truly logged out of an account, and is usually on a different device or has a friend logged in. You see, when IDV account binds are changed it doesn't kick out anyone who is logged in, and people can lie about what devices they have for logout proof. You can tell a leech has logged in by checking your secondary password for force close requests, your persona builds for odd behaviour, your messages for odd behaviour, matches that were played that you didn't play, and most obviously notifications interrupting your play that say "account was logged in from other place" or something along those lines. Again, make sure you have a secondary password. Without one, leeches are able to perform device transfer (DT) or same device transfers (SDT) and kick <i>you</i> off of the account. If they have the DMM removal method, which is circulating still in scammer circles, they can also perform one to remove you off of the account.

### Kicking a leech

Immediately once you notice leech activity, check if account migration/DT is open for you. If it is, perform the following steps:
0. BEFORE YOU START: **make sure** you have a new bind that isn't currently binded to any idv acc
1. generate migration code and pass in the security section
2. go to switch account -> migration [it's the one with two arrows]
3. enter the code and pass, click confirm
4. don't touch your binds rn, log in and make sure it's the same account
5. bind to new bind
This will kick all leeches from your account, but uses your transfer code. If device transfer isn't open, feel free to consult me or any other scammer force member that has DMs open for what to do next. You may need to look into DMM removal, but you all may not.

## Echo refund

Scammers who have spend money on the account via credit or debit card can refund their money and put your account into echo debt, making it unable to play matches in any gamemode (except Crystal Ball Tarot, unless they've fixed that) until the debt is paid off. This sucks and is totally unavoidable, so... yeah. Be wary of account with many echos.

## IDK what happened

You should have opened a scam report ticket anyways, but especially do so if this is occuring.
